I. Project Overview

This project is about predicting if someone is talking about disaster or not in a tweet. The data was downloaded from a Kaggle challenge called ”Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets”, and it has 7613 tweets for training as a csv file. There are four columns in the data file; keyword, location, text, and target. A few lines of train data are shown below. As can be seen, text is tweet, and target is disaster (1) or non-disaster (0). The goal of this project is to use the left three columns to predict the target.
